# Internal helper to produce an absolute file path. Specifically, the given
# argument is returned as-is if it is an absolute path (starts with '/').
# Otherwise it is returned with a "$TESTED/" prefix.

# Example:
#    _abs "foo/bar"  ⇒ "$TESTED/foo/bar"
#    _abs "/foo/bar" ⇒ "/foo/bar"

# normalized such that they begin with

#
# The path to the created file is echoed to standard output.

# Example:
#     normalizeStorePaths foo/bar.txt
